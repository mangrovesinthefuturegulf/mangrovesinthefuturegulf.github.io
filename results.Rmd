library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

```

### **Exploring the Data**

Here's a quick look at the read-in data's first 20 columns, including their label, class, and some data points.

```{r data first look}
data %>% # Using read-in data
  .[,1:20] %>% # Subset the first 20 columns
  dplyr::glimpse() # Using the glimpse() function in dplyr
```
